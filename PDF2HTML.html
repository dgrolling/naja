	<div class="HHIncome1">

	<p>This report presents data on median household income at the national and state levels based on the 2011 and 2012 American Community Survey (ACS).
	Estimates from the 2011 ACS and the 2012 ACS show no significant change in median household income at the national level and for most states.<sup>1</sup>
	National- and state-level income trend data back to the 2000 ACS are also discussed, along with 2012 ACS metropolitan area income estimates.<sup>2</sup>
	The ACS provides detailed estimates of demographic, social, economic, and housing characteristics for states, congressional districts, counties, places,
	and other localities every year. A description of the ACS is provided in the text box “What Is the American Community Survey?”</p>

	<p>In the 2012 ACS, information on income was collected between January and December 2012 and people were asked about income for the previous 12 months
	(the income reference period). This yielded a total income time span covering 23 months (January 2011 to November 2012). Therefore, adjacent ACS years have
	income reference months in common and comparisons of 2012 economic conditions with those in 2011 will not be precise.<sup>3</sup></p>

	<p>Real median household income in the United States showed no statistically significant change between the 2011 ACS and the 2012 ACS (see Table 1).<sup>4</sup> The ACS 2011 U.S. median household
	income was $51,324 and the ACS 2012 U.S. median household income was $51,371. This is the first time since the 2007 ACS that median household income did not decrease. From 2006 to 2007 there
	was a significant increase in U.S. median household income of 1.9 percent (see Figure 4).</p>

	<p>State estimates from the 2012 ACS ranged from $71,122 in Maryland to $37,095 in Mississippi (see Figure 1). Median household income was lower than the U.S. median in 27 states and higher in 20
	states and the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania ($51,230), Wisconsin ($51,059), and Iowa ($50,957) had median household income not statistically different from the U.S. median.<sup>5</sup></p>

	<p class="foot-para"><sup>5</sup> Median household incomes for Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Iowa are not statistically different from each other.</p>

	<p>For 44 states and the District of Columbia, real median household income in the 2012 ACS was not statistically different from that in the 2011 ACS.</p>

	<p>Between the 2011 ACS and the 2012 ACS, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Oregon were the only states that showed an increase in real median household income (see Figure 2). Between
	the 2010 ACS and the 2011 ACS, Vermont was the only state with a significant increase.<sup>6</sup> No state had an increase between the 2009 ACS and the 2010 ACS. Looking back to the 2008 and 2009 ACS,
	North Dakota was the only state to experience an increase in median household income (5.1 percent). Five states (Kansas, Louisiana, New York, New Jersey, and Texas) had increases between the 2007 ACS
	and the 2008 ACS, and between the 2006 ACS and the 2007 ACS, 33 states had increases in median household income.</p>

	<p>Real median household income decreased between the 2011 ACS and 2012 ACS in Missouri (1.6 percent) and Virginia (2.2 percent).<sup>7</sup> Comparatively, between the 2010 ACS and 2011 ACS, 18 state
	medians decreased. Between the 2009 ACS and the 2010 ACS, 35 states showed decreases in median household income. Between the 2008 ACS and the 2009 ACS, 34 states experienced decreases, and
	between the 2007 ACS and the 2008 ACS, 5 states had decreases.</p>
